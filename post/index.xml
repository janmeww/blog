      <description>A few years ago, I met an Arab who, upon seeing me read Sufi poetry, tried to warn me about Sufism as being &amp;ldquo;rather un-Islamic&amp;rdquo;. So I asked him how much he knew about Sufism and what he knew. It turned out, he did not know anything beyond the rumors.
And the rumors he had heard were to the effect, that Sufism is not the correct form of Islam because it attempts to justify things that are not normally permissible in Islam.</description>

      <description>Greetings and regards,
Hoping to put together my various introspections, ideas, and observations, in short, all of my writings in one place, I begin this site.
I write here once a week. You can use RSS to stay informed, or simply bookmark this site and visit once a week. I shall not add you to an annoying mailing list and pester you with reminders.
All the best,
Jan</description>
