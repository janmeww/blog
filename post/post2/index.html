				<h1 class="post__title">2. Is Sufism the Same As Islam?</h1>
				<div class="post__content"><p>A few years ago, I met an Arab who, upon seeing me read Sufi poetry, tried to warn me about Sufism as being &ldquo;rather un-Islamic&rdquo;. So I asked him how much he knew about Sufism and what he knew. It turned out, he did not know anything beyond the rumors.</p>
<p>And the rumors he had heard were to the effect, that Sufism is not the correct form of Islam because it attempts to justify things that are not normally permissible in Islam. Why did the Arab have such an opinion? And is this opinion right?</p>
<p>First off all, let&rsquo;s see what Sufism actually is. Sufi is a derivative of Saaf, which means clear, clean, and pure (all the same time). The Sufi is no one but a Moslem who correctly practices Islam&ndash;it is not an innovation in Islam (nor does Islam need any innovation. Islam is the perfect religion.).</p>
<p>And correctly practicing Islam means clearing your heart and soul of all things that prevent you from getting closer to your Maker Almighty. In other words, it means understanding the meaning of Islam and not being a superficial Moslem who is either nominally a Moslem, one who calls himself a Moslem but does not act like one; or someone who is outwardly a Moslem, one who acts like one (in deeds) but his heart is not tuned to the Islamic ideals, an ignorant Moslem who thinks Islam is &lsquo;merely&rsquo; a means to go to Paradise.</p>
<p>If you read major Sufi works, the one theme that reccurs is practicing Islam as it must be practiced. Sufism has nothing to do with all the strange behaviours and activities and ideas that enemies of Islam have deliberately introduced to it in order to subvert Moslems from the true path. It also has nothing to do with the stupidities of those who claim to know Sufism but actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As a case in point, there is on Twitter, a self-proclaimed &ldquo;Sufi Master&rdquo; who is teaching the world about Sufism. But in his classroom, which he posted online, there is a large statue of Buddha in the background. Sure Islam encourages tolerance but up to a point (of avoiding self-contradiction); the meaning of Sufism is not pantheism, nor is it mixing religions together.</p>
<p>The Islamic tolerance is based on the idea, that you can believe whatever you do, and I believe whatever I do. Only, don&rsquo;t mix things up. But the modern &ldquo;Sufists&rdquo; are mixing things up, causing many Moslems to ignore Sufi teachings. So the problem is in the fools who do this, and the subject itself should not be ignored because of this.</p>
<p>The erudite Islamic scholar Abdul-Hakim Murad says: &ldquo;Only Islam is good enough for Sufism&rdquo;, a statement which truly reflects two ideas. One, Islam is the Ultimate religion, but Sufism is the only valid approach to this religion. And two, you can&rsquo;t be a student of Sufism without being a Moslem first.</p>
<p>Think of Sufism as an interpretation of Islam that is truly based on what Islam truly is about. Don&rsquo;t let the fools, shills, and enemies of Islam dissuade you from this path, for the mere fact that such dissuasion attempts occur is proof enough for all of us to make up our own minds and see things for ourselves.</p>
<p>But in seeing things for yourself, if you don&rsquo;t speak either Arabic or Persian, you will have a problem: losses in translation. One remedy is to take up these languages and learn them. A slow but a sure path to knowledge. In the meantime, the other remedy is to find a good tranlation, and use critical thinking when reading it. At present, in English, most of the translations are mostly incomplete or in some cases wrong.</p>
<p>Even so, those by Arabic and Persian native speakers who appear like good, practicing Moslems, and who have a complete command of English, will be better than nothing. It would also help that these translators are Islamic scholars, for then, the translations would enjoy the contextual richness that would render them fully intelligible.</p>
