      <description>Welcome back!
You have probably arrived here after grokking my ten-episode free Lua programming tutorials on Quora.
If so, while I am writing the rest of the Lua tutorials, I have something for you in the meantime.(If not, then I suggest you head to my Lua tutorial space on Quora and grok it before coming back here.)
As a future programmer, it is imperative that you know at least one Lisp dialect so as to take that knowledge and delve deeper into the wonderful world of functional programming.</description>

      <description>Greetings and regards,
Hoping to put together my various introspections, ideas, and observations, in short, all of my writings in one place, I begin this site.
I write here once a week. You can use RSS to stay informed, or simply bookmark this site and visit once a week. I shall not add you to an annoying mailing list and pester you with reminders.
All the best,
Jan</description>
